pymel is now under the GNU Lesser General Public License


installation

The simplest way to setup pymel is to place the pymel folder in your scripts directory 

on win: My Documents/maya/8.5/scripts
on mac: ~/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/8.5/scripts
on linux: ~/maya/maya/8.5/scripts
	
alternately, if you have not done so already, it is a good idea to setup a separate directory for your python scripts so that
they will be accessible from within maya.  you can do this by setting the PYTHONPATH environment variable in Maya.env::  

	PYTHONPATH = $MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH

then place the pymel directory in your PYTHONPATH directory.

next, to avoid having to import pymel every time you startup, if you have not done so already, you can create a userSetup.mel
file, place it in your scipts directory and add this line::

	python("from pymel import *");

Note, that if you have your PYTHONPATH set in a shell resource file, this value will override your Maya.env value.
